# This file uses the interfaces-conf.py pre-processor script for global
# variable substitution.

# <-- GLOBAL VARIABLES DEFINITION --> (prevent typos + easy to find/modify)
# main ethernet trunk (your main network interface)
# the name of your wifi interface (using mac-based persistent names)
# vlan tag for trusted IoT devices (access to internal services + internet)
# vlan tag for trusted Mobile devices (access to internal services + internet)
# vlan tag for untrusted "External" IoT devices 
# ("smart home" devices that don't really *need* to call home in my opinion)
# why does my wifi lightbulb need to call home to some sus-looking chinese domains again?
# no internet access, no access to internal services, but can be accessed by trusted local subnets
# vlan tag for semi-trusted Guest devices (internet access, no access to internal services)

    # create virtual interfaces for the various SSIDs
    # iw command will fail to apply our custom interface names when using
    # MAC-based persistent names, so we add a fixed MAC address to the virtual
    # interface, then know its generated name, that we can then manually rename
    # to the desired one. It ain't pretty, but it works.
    # Also we need to supply fixed MAC addresses anyways for hostapd to work:
    # MACs must not overlap with block boundaries for hostapd to work
    # so we change the physical interface MAC (in this dummy example ending in "7f"
    # to (70), to prevent overflowing into :80 blocks, as otherwise hostapd would just die 
    # with a cryptic error during startup.
    # Also: yes, we pretty much rename and modify $IFACE here, which
    # is probably not very clean, but we *have* to supply a "real/managed" interface
    # to hostapd, which will then turn it into an "AP" interface. If we supply one
    # already in AP mode, hostapd will complain and refuse to start.
    # the renamed interface will then be configured *again* below under its new name 
    # (wlv_iot in this case)
    # also if you stop the hostapd service it will just delete all virtual interfaces, so
    # do the following steps to restore the correct configuration:
    # - service hostapd stop
    # - service networking restart
    # - service hostapd start
    # also ensure the VLAN interfaces come up properly :)
    # align the MAC address to the block boundaries so the virtual interfaces work as expected
